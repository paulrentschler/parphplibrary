# pwrentch

A PHP library of useful classes.

This is my library of useful classes that I have developed over years of coding various projects. They have been refactored, evolved, and changed over time as my needs warranted and my coding knowledge grew.


## Compatibility

The library is compatible with PHP 5.x. Currently it does not utilize namespaces because I still have code that runs on servers with PHP versions less than 5.3. When that changes, namespaces will be added.

I originally wrote these classes to be compatible with PHP4 but that was a long time ago and things change. Ideally everything here would get refactored to be compatible with modern PHP and utilize [namespaces](http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.php) to avoid any naming conflicts.


## Installation


## What's with the name?

The name is a play on my name. My last name is commonly misspelled with a "W", thus Wrentschler rather than Rentschler because it's pronounced "wrench-ler". Since this is a library of code much like a toolbox and a wrench is typically found in a toolbox, "wrentch" seemed appropriate. The "P" can stand for "Paul" or "PHP" which ever you prefer.
